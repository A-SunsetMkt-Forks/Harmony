# Harmony rules for Codex

* This is the only AGENTS.md file in the repository

* Relevant drafts and information are located in `./drafts/` and is named according to the topic.

* For simple edits, limit testing to net9 and x64.

* Respect .editorconfig when doing edits, especially for using whitespace

* Whitespace rules are TAB, CRLF endings. Longer than usual lines (~ 140 chars are ok)

* User dotnet format to format the code - it will respect the .editorconfig file.
